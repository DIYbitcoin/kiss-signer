## Install

For beta releases, flash this exact verified `.bin` using the README install steps.

The browser installer comes later with GitHub Pages. It will require Chrome, Brave, or Edge on desktop; Safari and Firefox cannot flash ESP32 boards over Web Serial.

After flashing, unplug the board, wait about 3 seconds, then plug it back in.

## Changelog

The plausible-deniability release. Drawing KISS now opens a real signer that is
not your main one, and your main one hides behind a stroke only you know.

### Added — a signer you can hand over

- **A decoy signer, behind the gesture everyone already knows.** Drawing KISS
  opens a working signer with no passphrase: its own fingerprint, pairs with a
  coordinator, signs real transactions. It is not a fake — it is your seed with
  an empty passphrase, which is a genuinely different wallet. Put a small amount
  in it so it is not suspiciously empty.
- **Your real wallet hides behind one extra stroke.** Draw KISS, then add an
  underline, overline, strike, slash, circle or check. Only that opens the
  passphrase prompt. Plain KISS always keeps working and always opens the decoy,
  so nobody can lock themselves out of their own device by forgetting a stroke.
- **Set during setup, changed only from the real wallet.** SETTINGS → WAYS IN
  does not exist in a decoy session, so the decoy never reveals that a second
  signer is configurable.
- **What a seed actually is.** The setup wizard now explains it: 12 words in the
  BIP39 list, that the words plus your passphrase *are* the wallet, and that the
  same words restore into Sparrow, BlueWallet or any BIP39 wallet.
- **A way out of WRITE THESE DOWN.** That screen had no exit at all — if you had
  no paper to hand, the only way out was pulling the power.
- **A warning before CREATE NEW SEED.** It walked straight into the wizard with
  nothing said. WIPE has always gated itself; now so does this.

### Fixed

- **Settings and SCAN QR appeared to freeze, and only a power cycle got out.**
  They were never frozen. Opening the decoy skipped the login screen, and the
  login screen was the only thing that switched on touch input for wallet
  screens — so the screen drew perfectly and ignored every tap. The game kept
  working because it reads the touch panel directly. This affected anyone
  unlocking with plain KISS. **This is the reason to update.**
- **The extra stroke was unreachable.** KISS was recognised the instant you
  lifted the last S, so the decoy opened before you could draw anything after
  it. The device now waits briefly for a stroke.
- **Circles had to be drawn small.** The bigger you drew the loop, the more
  precisely it had to close. Now a big, loosely-closed circle reads correctly.

### Changed

- **KISS is easier to draw.** The shape check was tuned when it guarded the
  passphrase prompt, where a false match was a giveaway. It now opens the decoy,
  where a fumbled shape costs nothing. Two S's are still required.
- **Creating a seed is always 12 words.** 128 bits is not brute-forceable, and
  24 words doubles the length of the one step where mistakes actually happen:
  copying them to paper. RESTORE still accepts 12 or 24.
- **ERASE SEED, not WIPE WALLET.** Erasing this device does not erase your
  wallet — your paper and passphrase still restore it. Calling it "wipe wallet"
  told you your coins were gone, which is the opposite of true and a bad thing
  to believe while deciding whether to press it.
- **The PSBT explainer says what the letters mean.** Partially Signed Bitcoin
  Transaction: a transaction built but not yet signed. The coordinator builds it
  and holds no keys; KISS holds the keys and stays offline. It no longer calls a
  PSBT a "file" — over QR there is no file anywhere.
- **A wallet with no passphrase stops describing one.** The fingerprint and
  warning screens used to talk about a passphrase you did not have, and the
  stroke setup was offered even though both ways in reached the same wallet.
